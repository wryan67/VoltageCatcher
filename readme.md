Voltage Catcher
---------------

Voltage catcher uses a Raspberry Pi with a MCP3008 chip to capture line voltages and save samples to csv files.  The progam can work with or without a [ST7789 LCD display with 240Ã—320 resolution](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081Q79X2F).  See the wiring diagram in the readme folder for instructions on connecting the MCP3008 and/or the LED display to your Raspberry Pi.   Once the data has been captured, you can then use WinScp or your favorite SFTP/SCP utility to copy the files to your PC or laptop.
